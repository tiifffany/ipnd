<b>Part 1: Learn to Code</b>
<br>Project: Getting Started with HTML
<br>- If you haven’t already created an HTML file to contain your notes from this section, refer back to the beginning of the lessons for setting up your file
<br>- To complete this project, you’ll need to submit your notes as an HTML file using the tags you learned about in these lessons, such as `<p>`,`<div>`, `<h1>`, `<b>`, `<em>`, and `<span>`
<br>- Keep it simple. CSS is used for styling and is not necessary for this project
<br>- Make sure you use proper HTML Document structure for your code
