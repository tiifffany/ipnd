            <div class="description"><p>In a city where it's quite hard to find different types of cuisines, <em>Pho 366</em> is a restaurant that will satisfy's anyone pho cravings. Since they don't have an official website, you can find their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Restaurant_Review-g303631-d10824861-Reviews-Pho_366-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html">Trip Advisor review</a> here.</p>
            <p>I took my sister along to try this restaurant with me and she also loved it! It had been a long time since she tried pho, that she even forgot what it tasted like. For those who don't know, pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup that is so easy to fall in love with. There are different variations of the soup, but my favorite is beef pho. We definitely recommend this place!</p></div>

    <h2 class="post_title">Bibimbap!</h2>
    <div class="app">
            <div class="screenshot"><img src="images/bibimbap.jpg" alt="bibimbap"></div>
            <div class="description"><p>For all you Korean food lovers in the southern area of São Paulo, good news! Now you won't have to go all the way to Bom Retiro or Aclimação to get good bibimbap.</p>
            <p>Bibimbap literally means "mixed rice" in Korean, and that's exactly what the dish is all about. It's usually rice mixed together with meat, vegetables and an egg. People usually add gochujang (a red chilli pepper paste) to the mix, along with a little bit of sesame oil. So delicious!</p>
            <p>This place has a proper website, but the owners keep their Instagram account more updated, so you can follow them <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/restaurante.babzip/">here</a> to keep up with the restaurant's news.</p></div>
