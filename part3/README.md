<b>Part 3: Code Your Own Quiz</b>
<br>Project: Code Your Own Quiz
<br><br>For this project you'll be building a fill-in-the-blanks quiz. Your quiz will prompt a user with a sentence containing several blanks. The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the sentence.
<br>- Use of Variables: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable names should reflect the values they store
<br>- Functions: Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.
<br>- Appropriate use of Data: Data types (`strings` vs `lists` for example) should be used appropriately
<br>- Appropriate use of other coding techniques: Your code should use statements like `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, etc... appropriately
<br>- Each function includes a comment: Comments explain function behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable.)
