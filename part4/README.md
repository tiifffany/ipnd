<b>Part 4: Create a Movie Website</b>
<br>Mini Project: Draw Turtles
<br>
<br>Project: Create a Movie Trailer Website
<br>- Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
<br>- Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
<br>- To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called `fresh_tomatoes.py` - this module has a function called <b>open_movies_page</b> that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
<br>- Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser
<br>For this project, you will need to submit a zip of your project files saved as `movie_website.zip`. Your zip should include three Python files: `media.py`, `entertainment_center.py`, and `fresh_tomatoes.py`
